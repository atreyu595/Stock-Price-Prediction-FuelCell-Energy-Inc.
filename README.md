A student during the day but a Stock Investor at night, I'm always looking at opportunities to apply my Data Science skill sets in Quantitative Finance. What's not a better way than sharpening my skills by implementing a Recurrent Neural Network to help analyze and predict prices at any given timestamp. 

The following program was implemented in Jupyter Labs using Python's Scikit-Learn, Keras, TensorFlow, Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy and Matplotlib libraries.

The Repository has the following file(s):
